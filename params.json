{"google":"","body":"# Meister\r\n\r\nMeister is a CLI tool that aims to ease setting up a complex system of\r\nservers on a cloud hosting provider.  It works by creating a yaml\r\nconfiguration file that contains all configuration that you want to\r\nprovision to a cloud hosting provider. That file can then be version\r\ncontrolled so that changes in the server stack are easily overviewed.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n    \r\n\t(sudo) python setup.py install\r\n\r\n# The meister.yml file\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    # The management server is the main server.\r\n\t# A history of the meister.yml is stored here so that changes can be executed.\r\n    managementServer: mgmt\r\n\r\n    # The key file is the private key to use when connecting to new hosts.\r\n    keyFile: /path/to/keyfile\r\n\r\n    # Tasks can be executed on nodes.

Create a meister.yml file.\r\n3. Optionally create a python module with tasks that should be\r\nexecuted on the machine. Refer to the\r\n[Fabric documentation](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.5/) for more\r\ninfo.\r\n2. run meister provision:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\tmeister provision\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Verify that all machines are running on the aws console.\r\n\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\nThere are several things that still needs to be done:\r\n\r\n1. Proper error handling\r\n2. Nice looking CLI\r\n3. Commands for initializing and modifiyng the meister.yml file\r\n4. Be able to remove unused nodes after removing them from the meister.yml file\r\n5. Code refactoring to fit PEP 8 standards\r\n","name":"Meister","tagline":"Keep track of complex cloud setups!","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
